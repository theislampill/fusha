# Verb Form And Mood Review

For a verb token, record:

- root and derived form;
- perfect/imperfect/imperative;
- active/passive voice;
- person, number, and gender;
- subject marker or hidden subject;
- object or possessive suffixes;
- visible proclitics before the verb;
- any governing particle that may affect mood or force.

Sarf may certify form and voice. Nahw decides contextual mood and force when a
governor is present: `لم`, `لن`, `لا` of prohibition, imperative lām, purpose
lām, causal fā', comitative wāw, `أن`, `كي`, `حتى`, or conditional particles.

Bare infinitive hovers are unsafe for finite verbs when person, number, suffix,
imperative force, passive voice, or context materially changes the visible
token contribution.

## Dogfood finding: finite verbs need internal composition

The 2026-06-27 dogfood batch promoted two verb defects into permanent checks:

- `يَسْـَٔلُكَ`: record `يَـ` imperfect prefix, `سْـَٔلُ` host stem/root, and
  `كَ` attached object pronoun. The hover may be concise, but the breakdown must
  preserve `OBJ.2MS`; a lemma-style "to ask, question" or a hidden-only suffix is
  not rich-certified.
- `فَأَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ`: record `فَ` separately, then the Form IV perfect active
  1st-person plural verb with attached 3rd-person masculine plural object. A
  fluent phrase such as "so We destroyed them" still needs a parse key and
  component table before it can be used as a model row.

When the subject is supplied by a following explicit noun, the verb form still
keeps its own person/number/gender. Do not replace the finite morphology with a
dictionary entry gloss.

Rich-hover readiness:

- include form/voice/aspect/person/number in `parse_key.key`, e.g.
  `V:IV:PERF:ACT:1P+OBJ.3MS`;
- assign `qg-verb` to the stem and `qg-pronoun` to visible subject/object
  suffixes;
- hand any governing particle, mood, prohibition, cause/result, or condition
  relation to nahw before finalizing the parse key;
- leave the row pending if the verb can only be described by a root-family or
  infinitive gloss.
