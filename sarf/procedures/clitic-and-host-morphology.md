# Clitic And Host Morphology

Before accepting a host gloss, segment the written token into visible pieces:

- proclitics such as `و`, `ف`, `ب`, `ل`, `ك`, article `ال`;
- the host stem and its root/form/POS;
- suffix pronouns and inflectional endings;
- false-clitic traps such as tanwin-alif, long vowels, and lexical final letters.

An exact host match does not certify the whole written token. The public hover
must account for visible clitics when they affect the token contribution.
For rich-hover readiness, also emit a compact `parse_key.key` and one
`qamus-grammar-v1` display class per segment, following
[`../../curriculum/qamus-hover-parse-key-and-color.md`](../../curriculum/qamus-hover-parse-key-and-color.md).

Examples:

- `بِسَلَامٍ` cannot be only `peace`;
- `بِبَدْرٍ` cannot be only `Badr`;
- `جَادَلُوكَ` cannot be only `to argue/dispute`;
- `وَلْيَعْفُوا` cannot be only `pardon`.

## Dogfood finding: plus-sign hovers are not learner explanations

The 2026-06-27 full-corpus dogfood batch found populated hovers that were
string-correct enough to be readable, but not rich-certified enough to teach the
token. Treat `and + the stars`-style text as a fallback symptom, not completion.

For tokens such as `وَٱلشَّمْسُ`, `وَٱلْقَمَرُ`, `وَٱلنُّجُومُ`,
`وَٱلْجِبَالُ`, and `وَٱلشَّجَرُ`:

- segment the written token as `وَ` + `ٱل` + host noun;
- keep the visible Arabic token intact in any renderer handoff;
- emit component roles for the renderer and learner breakdown;
- do not count the row rich-certified merely because the visible gloss says
  `and + the ...`;
- send the `وَ` function to nahw before allowing any parse-family propagation.

For tokens such as `بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ`, record bā' + article + host. A generic
"by what is right/customary" gloss can be understandable, but it is not a
complete rich-hover certification unless the preposition, article, host, and PP
role are visible in the breakdown.

If the clitic function is syntactic rather than purely morphological, sarf
records the segmentation and defers to nahw. Do not invent a color/parse-key
explanation for a segment whose function is still unknown; use an exact blocker
such as `particle_function_uncertified` or `preposition_role_uncertified`.

## Dogfood finding: preposition and oath hosts need their governors

The 2026-06-27 preposition/oath dogfood batch found host-only hovers on tokens
whose visible governor is part of the written word.

Sarf must preserve these pieces before nahw chooses the contextual function:

- `بِذُنُوبِهِمْ`: `بِـ` + plural noun host + possessive suffix `هِمْ`.
- `بِذُنُوبِكُم`: `بِـ` + plural noun host + possessive suffix `كُم`.
- `بِرُوحِ` / `بِرُوحٍ`: `بِـ` + host noun; referent and relation stay gated.
- `بِبَابِلَ`: `بِـ` + proper place host.
- `وَطُورِ`: oath/coordinating `وَ` + governed host.
- `وَهَٰذَا`: oath/coordinating `وَ` + demonstrative host.

Do not let an article, preposition, oath particle, or suffix pronoun become
component-only metadata while the public hover reads like the bare host. If the
host is known but the governor/function is not, emit the segmentation and route
to nahw with `preposition_role_uncertified`, `oath_function_uncertified`, or
`pp_attachment_uncertified`.
