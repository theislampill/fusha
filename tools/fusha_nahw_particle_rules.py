"""Consumer for the PARTICLE domain of nahw/rules/ — homograph harakāt, negation scope, state transitions.

Three rule files, one bounded domain (naḥw principles 1 and 3). This is deliberately NOT a general naḥw
resolver: it answers only "which reading does the CONTENT-LETTER diacritic license?", "what does the governing
negative do to the gloss?", and "may this reading take that syntactic role?".

  nahw/rules/particle-context-rules.json   -> resolve_particle_homograph()
  nahw/rules/negation-rules.json           -> negation_effect()
  nahw/rules/state-transition-rules.json   -> transition() / forbidden_gloss_violations()

**Prose is never executed.** Each rule's `when` / `reason` / `why_forbidden` text is documentary. Behaviour comes
from (a) a CLOSED discriminator registry keyed by rule id — the same idiom as the ṣarf increment discriminators in
tools/skill_fixtures/ — which reports structured observations from tools.normalize_ar, and (b) the rule DATA
(`members`, `decision_if_A/B`, `pending_fallback`, `governs`, `forbidden_gloss`, `two_vote_trigger`). A rule id with
no registered discriminator is reported `documentary`, never guessed at; rule_status() is the truthful inventory.

Fail-open is forbidden: an absent diacritic yields the file's own `pending_fallback`, never the frequent reading.

# typed, source-addressed observations — the ONLY thing that may move a state
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A caller label is not evidence, and neither is an address-SHAPED string. `trigger_observed=True`,
# `maa_function="negation"`, `referent_class="human"` and a free mood string are assertions BY the caller.
# Every state-moving input must be a validated, immutable OBSERVATION ARTIFACT:
#
#   {"observation_id": "obs:<hex>", "producer": "<authorized producer id>",
#    "evidence_class": "source_addressed", "source_address": "quran:2:284:1",
#    "occurrence": {"quran_loc": "2:284", "word": 1, "surface": "لِّلَّهِ"},
#    "target": {"kind": "token|state|referent|surface", "value": "<the exact thing under decision>"},
#    "observation": "<closed-vocabulary value>", "integrity": "<sha256 of the artifact minus integrity>"}
#
# Five independent checks, each of which alone fails the artifact closed:
#   1. SHAPE      — every field present; a bare boolean/string/label is rejected outright.
#   2. PRODUCER   — must be in OBSERVATION_PRODUCERS. A caller-minted producer is not evidence.
#   3. COORDINATE — `source_address` must resolve IN SCOPE against the repository's own authority
#                   (tools/fusha_check.resolve_address over qamus/indexes/current/quran-usage-spine-full.jsonl).
#                   quran:999:999:999 and an out-of-range word index both fail. No local coordinate
#                   authority is invented here, and \A..\Z anchoring rejects a newline-suffixed address.
#   4. BINDING    — `occurrence` and `target` must match the exact token/surface/state/referent under
#                   decision. Re-using an observation for another token, surface, from-state or referent
#                   fails closed.
#   5. INTEGRITY  — the artifact must hash to its own `integrity` value, so a mutated field is detectable.
#
# HONEST LIMIT. The repository has no signing observation producer and no per-word WRITTEN-SURFACE authority
# (the spine carries token counts and glosses, not surfaces). So `occurrence.surface` is bound and compared but
# cannot be *verified*, and every producer currently registered is a FIXTURE producer. A validated artifact can
# therefore only ever yield `candidate`; nothing here returns `resolved` from an observation. The missing
# producer + surface authority is packetized as TP-NAHW-A2-OBSERVATION-PRODUCER.
