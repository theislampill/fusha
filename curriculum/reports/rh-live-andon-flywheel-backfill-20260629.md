# RH-LIVE ANDON Flywheel Backfill - 2026-06-29

This report records the repo-only teaching and skill updates made after RH-LIVE public-rollout ANDONs exposed
reusable learner failures. It does not mutate live Qamus, does not append whitelist rows, does not rebuild WBW, and
does not claim public coverage movement.

## Inputs Mined

- RH-LIVE particle rollout ANDONs from p066, p072, p074, p075, p077, p078, p079, p084, p094, and p096-p100.
- Existing RH-LIVE split-layer/role-color fixture lessons.
- Existing adjacent-context gloss lesson for `يَسْأَلُكَ`.
- Existing curriculum assessment/progress/tutor-runtime scaffolding.
- Existing sarf/nahw dogfood drills and parse-key/color curriculum.

No external source wording was copied into learner-facing curriculum. The examples below are Qamus-authored
teaching prompts derived from observed defect classes.

## Repeated Findings Promoted

| finding | example shape | repo surface updated | blocker class taught |
|---|---|---|---|
| Role color cannot collapse morphology into broad POS | `يُحْيِي`, `فَأَهْلَكْنَاهُمْ` | `curriculum/qamus-hover-parse-key-and-color.md`, `curriculum/drills/parse-key-and-color-layer.md`, schema/validator | `renderer_only_gap`, `hidden_imperfect_prefix` |
| Dual/plural endings must be visible | `بُرْهَٰنَانِ`, `قاعدون`, `ٱلْغَٰلِبُونَ` | sarf drills, assessment row `L3-dual-burhanan`, missed-error log | `hidden_number_morphology` |
| Participle/adjective rows must not inherit infinitives | `مُّطَاعٍۢ`, `قَدِيرٌ`-style adjective rows | `sarf/drills/nominal-derivatives.md`, assessment row `L5-participle-mutaa` | `hidden_derivative_shape`, `finite_verb_dictionary_gloss` |
| Passive suffix-bearing verbs need more than host gloss | `أُورِثْتُمُوهَا` | `sarf/drills/clitic-and-host-morphology.md`, assessment row `L7-passive-suffix-urithtumuha` | `suffix_omitted`, `wrong_irab_reasoning` |
| Learner explanations must teach Arabic, not workflow | hover explanation containing process/source-boundary prose | `nahw/drills/dogfood-nahw-remediation.md`, assessment row `L8-process-prose-hover` | `process_prose_in_hover` |
| Qur'an display text must be deterministic before segmentation | missing hamza/maddah/diacritics or selected target word | sarf/nahw dogfood drills, assessment row `L8-source-text-display-gate`, tutor routing | `quran_display_text_mismatch` |
| Card-level rollout reporting cannot hide visible flat cards | p007-style "row denominator complete" with visible blocked card | `curriculum/drills/hover-composition-and-routing.md`, missed-error log, tutor routing | `card_level_coverage_hidden` |
| Noun/adjective hosts need root/base where certifiable | common noun/adjective rows with blank root while proper/function rows need no-root reason | `sarf/SKILL.md`, parse-key/color contract | `root_family_vibes`, `renderer_only_gap` |
| Fine-grained grammar facts must still use supported renderer classes | live validator rejected unsupported active-participle/adverb classes | `curriculum/qamus-hover-parse-key-and-color.md`, `qamus/reports/morphosyntax-token-contract.md`, `sarf/SKILL.md`, `nahw/SKILL.md`, parse/color drill | `unsupported_renderer_class`, `grammar_fact_hidden_by_class_mismatch` |

## Explicit No-Ops

| finding | no-op reason |
|---|---|
| `يَسْأَلُكَ` token contribution vs adjacent subject | Already covered by assessment row `L8-verb-suffix-yasaluka`, hover-composition drill, and RH-LIVE context-gloss fixture. This pass only references it as precedent. |
| Parenthesis wrapping and horizontal scroll in live cards | Renderer/app layout issue, not a sarf/nahw skill rule. Kept as a source/display warning in drill prose; no live app change made here. |
| Entry URL p/v/n graph generation | Live rollout tooling issue. This backfill records the card-level/source-text lesson but does not edit live graph generation. |
| Additional live whitelist payloads | Out of scope for this repo-only curriculum pass. No live Qamus mutation was authorized by this task. |

## Addendum: VN-RH-LIVE-00 Renderer-Class Normalization

During a later VN-RH-LIVE-00 append, the live renderer validator accepted the grammar analysis but rejected payload
classes outside the committed palette. The repaired rule is: keep active-participle and adverbial facts in sarf/nahw
fields, segment labels, morphlines, and learner explanations, but render them with supported classes unless a future
change updates schema, CSS, DOM fixture, validators, and regression checks together.

## Addendum: P-RH-LIVE-02 p066 Lightened `إِنْ`

The p066 card `إِنْ هَٰذَٰنِ لَسَٰحِرَٰنِ` exposed a particle-function trap: word-level evidence may leave `إِنْ`
ambiguous or even conflicting, while the phrase-level frame with the following emphatic lām settles the lightened
`إِنَّ` reading for this exact row. The flywheel update adds a `lightened_inna` eval row and tightens the nahw
remediation drill: do not certify conditional or negative `إِنْ` from surface alone; require the surrounding frame.

## Addendum: Graph-Driven Rollout Control Plane

The 2026-06-29 NorthStar addendum made the control-plane lesson explicit: the edge graph is not after-the-fact
evidence. It is the rollout spine. Future curriculum, tutor, and agent checks must require an edge join table before
manual probing when the graph already supplies the route from entry to card to selected word to quran/wbw loc to
rendered span.

Backfilled teaching surfaces:

- `curriculum/drills/hover-composition-and-routing.md` now teaches graph-first routing, four separate denominators,
  cachebuster/DUV proof, and health-wait/source-runtime parity.
- `curriculum/tutor-runtime-routing.md` routes graph-ignored rollout claims, stale-asset color claims, and premature
  restart failures to concrete remediation checks.
- `curriculum/assessment/level-checkpoints.sample.jsonl` adds graded rows for edge-join denominators and
  cache/parity readback.
- `curriculum/progress/missed-error-log.template.md` adds missed-error classes for ignored graph joins,
  cache/parity gaps, and skipped health waits.

This is repo-only. It does not assert that a live app route, whitelist append, service restart, or public coverage
claim occurred.

## Future Work

- Migrate older broad-class fixtures toward role-aware preferred classes in a dedicated fixture-only pass.
- Add a repo-side validator for card-level rollout reports so visible blocked cards cannot be hidden by row-only
  denominators.
- Add a graph-join fixture/validator for rollout reports so missing entry/card/selected-word edges cannot silently
  fall into manual discovery.
- Extend rich-hover fixture samples for noun/adjective number and derivative shapes after the live data packet is
  stable.
- Continue the live RH-LIVE rollout in its own lane; feed any new repeated defect class back into this curriculum
  and skill flywheel.
